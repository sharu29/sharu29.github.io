      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m currently a PhD student at Charles University, but during my research
        I discovered that what I really enjoy is working with data and solving
        technical problems—writing scripts, cleaning datasets, and building tools
        to make sense of complex information.
      </p>
      <p>
        This passion led me to <strong>42 Prague</strong>, where I’ve immersed
        myself in programming, low-level systems, and collaborative development.
        I’m excited to combine my academic background with practical tech skills
        to tackle real-world challenges.
