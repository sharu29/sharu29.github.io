      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m Sharumathi — a PhD student who found a real love for working with data and building things with code. My background is in population genetics, where I spent a lot of time analyzing big datasets, writing Python scripts, and solving research problems. Somewhere along the way, I realized it wasn’t just the science I enjoyed, but the tech behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That led me to 42 Prague, where I’ve been learning software engineering the hands-on way. Now I’m focused on combining my data skills with tech to solve real-world problems. This site is a little space to share the projects I’ve worked on and the things I’m learning along the way.
      </p>

        Thanks for stopping by — feel free to check out my work or say hi!
